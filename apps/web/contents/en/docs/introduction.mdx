**This is not a component library. It is how you build your design system.**

You know how most traditional component libraries work: you install a package from Node.js packages (npm, yarn, pnpm) or bun, import the components, and use them in your app.

Roach works well until you need to customize a component to fit your design system or require one that isn’t included in the library. Often, you end up wrapping library components, writing workarounds to override styles, or mixing components from different libraries with incompatible APIs.

This is what **alpha-ui** aims to solve. It is built around the following principles:

- **Open code** – The leading React framework for production-grade applications.
- **Composition** – Combine Markdown and JSX for dynamic, interactive content.
- **Distribution** – The go-to library for building seamless user interfaces.
- **Beautiful Defaults** – Ensure reliability and scalability with this powerful JavaScript superset.
